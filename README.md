## Description
This repository contains the MATLAB code used for the numerical examples in the paper
Jeffrey S. Ovall, and Samuel E. Reynolds, "Quadrature for Implicitly-defined Finite Element Functions on Curvilinear Polygons," Computers & Mathematics with Applications (2022), Vol. 107 (1), pp. 1â€“16.

The quadrature approximates the integrals $\int_K v\,w\;dx$ and $\int_K \nabla v\cdot\nabla w\;dx$, where $K \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a curvilinear polygon and $v,w$ have polynomial Laplacians and have continuous Dirichlet traces on the boundary $\partial K$, such that the restriction to one edge is the trace of a polynomial. In our paper, we show that these volumetric integrals can be reduced to boundary integrals, and provide a corresponding quadrature, which is implemented here.

A demonstration of the quadrature is provided in [main.m](main.m). Please see the comments in main.m on how to use the code.

We ultimately plan to use this quadrature method to implement an efficient, high-order FEM on curvilinear meshes in 2-d domains. Our previous work demonstrated that the lowest order case is feasible, see "Trefftz Finite Elements on Curvilinear Polygons" by A. Anand, J. Ovall, S. Reynolds, S. Weisser, SIAM J. of Sci. Comp. (2018).
